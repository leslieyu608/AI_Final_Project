This is the reason why the magic of Real Life is so powerful. It is used to destroy all the evil forces that are in the realm of real life. Real people can not be destroyed, because they have to be killed. However, in TheRaland, people do not have the power to kill. So, The People are always on the lookout for the Evil forces. To defeat them, They have special equipment, which they use to fight against the forces of Evil. These special items are magically called "magic items". They are used in magic tricks, to make people believe that they cannot kill, that the creatures of reality are real. When the citizens of Areal are killed, it is because of magic items that Alive People can be saved. A real person is needed to save the children of this world from the curse of death.</s>
